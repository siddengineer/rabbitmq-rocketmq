Background processing.

Event-driven microservices in small/medium scale apps.

üöÄ RocketMQ

Type: Distributed messaging & streaming platform (high performance, inspired by Kafka).

Protocol: Custom (but has some AMQP-compatible bridges).

Strengths:

Extremely high throughput & low latency (built for Alibaba-scale e-commerce).

Handles millions of messages per second.

Better support for event streaming + transactional messages.

Use Cases:

E-commerce (flash sales, order processing).

Financial transactions.

IoT telemetry at massive scale.

Large-scale event streaming like Kafka.
